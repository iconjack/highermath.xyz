<h4>Introduction: The 4-Number Game</h4>

<p>
    Start with any four non-negative integers, and
    and at each stage, form a new row by taking the 
    absolute differences between adjacent elements:
<pre>
         3     9     4     12
         6     5     8      9 
         1     3     3      3 
         2     0     0      2 
         2     0     2      0 
         2     2     2      2 
         0     0     0      0 
         0     0     0      0 
         0     0     0      0 

</pre>
</p>
<p>It will later be shown that no matter what 4 numbers you start with,
  eventually you'll end up at 0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0.  This is not true for the n-number
  game in general.

</pre>

<p>
In what follows, $v$ will be an n-vector of numbers, $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$.
</p>
<p>
    Let operator $\partial v = \left(|v_1-v_2|, |v_2-v_3|,\dots,|v_n-v_1|\right)$, called the <i>diffy</i> operator.
    We are to study the fate of an initial n-vector $v_0$. Does it go to all 0's? Does it always repeat, or can it
    go on forever without repeating, like an irrational number?
</p>
<h5>
  We must always end up in a cycle.
</h5>
<p>
  If the maxium value in a given vector $v$ is $M$, then the absolute difference between it
  and its two neighbors is at most $M$. That is, the max can only go down or stay the same.
  Let's call this the <em>Maxiumum Principle</em>:
  $$ Maxiumum Principle: for every vector v, \max \partial v \le \max v $$
  By this principle, we can see that for a given initial vector, only a finite number of
  states are possible, therefore we must always end up in a cycle. 

</p>
<h5>
  All nodes within a cycle have the same max M.
</h5>
<p>
  Since the max can never increase, if the max ever went down, it could never go back
  up to agree with itself. Thus by the Maximum Principle, the max must stay the same
  within the cycle.
</p>
<h5>
  In-cycle nodes contain 0 or M only.
</h5>
<p>
Let $\rho v = (v_2, v_3, \dots, v_n, v_1)$, the rotate (left) operator. 
</p>
<h5>
  (0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 1) will always end up in a maximal cycle.
</h5>
<p>
$\partial$ is linear and thus if $\partial^s = \partial^t$, then 
</p>
<h5>
  (0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1) will always be in a maximal cycle.
</h5>
<p>

</p>
<p>
We immediately notice three things. Both $\partial$ and $\rho$ are linear operators, i.e.
$$ \partial (\lambda v) = \lambda \partial v $$
and
</p>
$$ \rho (\lambda v) = \lambda \rho v $$
$$ \partial \rho v = \rho \partial v $$
<p>
    Theorems
    $$ \max \partial v \le \max v $$
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Theorem 2  (Maximum Principle)</h3>
    For every vector  v, max ∂v ≤ max v. <br>
    In other words, the maximum can never go up. It can only go down or stay the same.
</p>
<p>
    From the maxiumum principle we get that every node in a given cycle has the same max.
    From that, in turn, we get that an in-cycle node must contain a 0 next to the max.
    Somehow from that we get that in-cycle nodes consist only of 0's and M's, where M is the max.

    
    The first insight comes from Ken's observation that max ∂v ≤ max v. That is, the max can only go down or stay the same.
    Since all nodes in a cycle are both successors and predecessors, that means the max must remain constant inside a cycle.
    If  m  is the max, then an in-cycle node  v  must have at least one m.  Furthermore, its successor  ∂v  must contain an
    m, so the difference between some pair of adjacent elements of  v  must be m.  Thus, v necessarily has an m that is next
    to a 0.Because of the symmetries involved, we can then assume that an in-cycle node is of the form  (m, 0, ....),
    alternatively (0, m, ...).
    Let v be in-cycle and
    Let  n  be the sum of the lengths of the runs of v containing only m's and 0's, and at least one m.For example, for m =
    5 and v = (2,5,0,0,5,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,2,5,0,4,5,5),  the number would be 4 +2 + 2 = 8. The run of three 0's in the middle
    doesn't contribute. If there even one non-max, non-zero element in  v, then the n-value for the successor of v will
    strictly go down.  Note that m's cannot be created outside our chosen segments. As can be seen in the
    above example, 0's can be created but only in the interior of a non-chosen segment.
    Also note that we could just use the simpler "number of m's" because it's possible that this value could increase.
    Example:  (0,5,0,5,1,2) -> (5,5,5,4,1,1).
      Thus if the vector v was not purely 0's and m's then m is not the max after all, a contradiction.    
</p>
<p>
    Since every in-cycle vector is made up of 0's and m's, when studying cycles, we can divide
    everything through by m, and just work with 0-1 vectors.
    In fact, |x−y| is simply x ⊕ y, that is xor, when x and y are {0,1}.
    Treating our vectors now as bit vectors, we see that
    $\rho$ is the machine instruction rotate left, and <br />
    $\partial$ is a rotate combined with an xor.
